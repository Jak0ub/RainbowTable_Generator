## Description
Using this tool you can easily make your own rainbow tables. If you want to make rule based rainbow table or customize this wordlist, I strongly recommend tool named `John The Ripper`


> ⚠️ **Warning:**  
> Threading is not implemented, so if you want to make larger rainbow tables, where you need speed, than i do not recommend this program for you
